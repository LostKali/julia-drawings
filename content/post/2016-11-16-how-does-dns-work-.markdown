There is also a cool longer comic about how DNS works at
[https://howdns.works/](https://howdns.works/). This was inspired by the
recent [DNS outage which took down a bunch of sites](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/internet-outage-ddos-dns-dyn/).

Right now this is wrong about CNAME records because those only work on
subdomains. I'll fix it later.
